# Second project for MN - Matrix solver

This is second project for Numerical Methods subject at GUT in year 2024.
Main task is implementing the different methods of matrix solving such as:
- Gauss-Seidel method
- Jacobi method
- LU factorization method

There should be also a comparison of effectiveness of these three methods.
